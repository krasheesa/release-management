# Systems Frontend Fixes Applied

## Issues Fixed:

### 1. ✅ Create new systems navigation issue
- **Problem**: Creating new systems was going to its own page instead of staying in embedded mode
- **Fix**: Updated `handleSystemNavigation` in Home.js to properly handle embedded mode
- **Fix**: Updated SystemForm to accept `parentSystemId` prop and work in embedded mode

### 2. ✅ Subsystem creation navigation issue
- **Problem**: After creating subsystem, page navigation was broken with missing top bar
- **Fix**: Added `handleSubsystemNavigation` function in Home.js
- **Fix**: Updated SystemDetail to use `onNavigateToSubsystem` callback for embedded mode
- **Fix**: Modified SystemForm to handle `parentSystemId` properly and stay in embedded mode

### 3. ✅ Systems display issue clarification  
- **Status**: SystemManager correctly shows associated builds when expanded
- **Status**: SystemDetail shows both system builds and subsystems as intended
- **Confirmed**: The functionality is working as designed

### 4. ✅ Parent system selection in subsystem creation
- **Problem**: Parent system dropdown was showing all systems when creating subsystem
- **Fix**: Modified SystemForm to automatically set parent system when creating subsystem
- **Fix**: Parent system field now shows as read-only text field when preset
- **Fix**: Dropdown is hidden when parent is already determined

## Technical Changes Made:

### Home.js
- Added `parentSystemId` state variable
- Added `handleSubsystemNavigation` function
- Updated `handleSystemNavigation` to handle embedded mode properly
- Updated render functions to pass correct props

### SystemDetail.js
- Added `onNavigateToSubsystem` prop
- Updated `handleSubsystemClick` and `handleCreateSubsystem` to use callback
- Fixed edit button to work in embedded mode

### SystemForm.js
- Added `parentSystemId` prop
- Modified parent system selection to be read-only when preset
- Updated form initialization to use parentSystemId
- Fixed navigation to stay in embedded mode

## Embedded Mode Flow:
1. **System Manager** → Create System → **System Form** (embedded)
2. **System Detail** → Create Subsystem → **System Form** (embedded, parent preset)
3. **System Detail** → Edit System → **System Form** (embedded, edit mode)
4. **System Detail** → View Subsystem → **System Detail** (embedded)

## UI Improvements:
- Parent system field shows as disabled text input when preset
- All navigation stays within the Home component embedded view
- Top navigation bar and side menu remain visible throughout
- Proper back navigation to system manager

All requested issues have been resolved and the systems frontend now works seamlessly in embedded mode while maintaining the navigation structure.

# Systems UI Updates - Applied Changes

## ✅ Issue 1: SystemManager Expansion Shows Subsystems
**Before**: Expanding systems showed associated builds
**After**: Expanding systems now shows subsystems with view buttons

**Changes Made:**
- Modified `SystemManager.js` to load and display subsystems instead of builds
- Updated `loadSystemBuilds()` → `loadSystemSubsystems()` 
- Changed expansion content to show subsystem list with:
  - Subsystem name and description
  - Creation date
  - View button to navigate to subsystem detail

## ✅ Issue 2: Hide Subsystems from Main Systems Page
**Before**: Main systems page showed both root systems and subsystems
**After**: Main systems page only shows root systems (no parent_id)

**Changes Made:**
- Updated filter in `SystemManager.js` to exclude systems with `parent_id`
- Modified `getSystemType()` function to only distinguish "System" vs "Parent System"
- Subsystems are now only visible:
  - When expanding a parent system (shows as list)
  - When viewing system detail page

## ✅ Issue 3: Auto-select Parent System in Subsystem Creation
**Before**: Parent system dropdown showed all systems when creating subsystem
**After**: Parent system is automatically set and displayed as read-only text

**Changes Made:**
- Enhanced `SystemForm.js` with better `parentId` handling
- Added `useEffect` to auto-set parent_id when creating subsystem
- Parent system field shows as disabled text input (not dropdown)
- Form title changes to "Create New Subsystem" when parent is set

## New CSS Styles Added:
- `.system-subsystems` - Container for subsystem list
- `.subsystems-list` - Flex layout for subsystem items
- `.subsystem-item` - Individual subsystem card styling
- `.view-subsystem-btn` - Button to view subsystem details

## Navigation Flow Updated:
1. **Systems Manager** → Shows only root systems
2. **Expand System** → Shows subsystems list (not builds)
3. **View Subsystem** → Opens subsystem detail page
4. **System Detail** → Shows both builds AND subsystems
5. **Create Subsystem** → Parent auto-selected, form title updated

## UI Hierarchy:
```
Systems Manager (Root Systems Only)
├── System A
│   ├── [Expand] → Subsystem A1, A2, A3 (with View buttons)
│   └── [View] → System A Detail Page
│       ├── System A Builds
│       └── System A Subsystems (with full CRUD)
└── System B  
    ├── [Expand] → No subsystems
    └── [View] → System B Detail Page
        └── System B Builds
```
